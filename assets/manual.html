    <h3>Caesura Instruction Manual</h3>
    <p>
      People of Earth, I present to you the fruits of my free time.<br/>
      <b>Please take a moment and read this entire manual before you start, or if you have access to a computer, visit the more comprehensive online guide
      at</b> <span color="#00FF00">www.gundersoft.com/caesura</span>
    </p>
    <p><b>Introduction:</b><br/>
      What is Caesura exactly, you might ask? Terrific question! Caesura is anything you want it to be. It started out as a remote administration suite but 
      is slowly expanding, making it applicable as a parental control program, lost phone finder, Remote monitoring solution, and even a practical joke app
      for the "TROLLS" among us ;) Please keep in mind, any usage of this software is the responsibility of the user. Gundersoft and Christian Gunderman shall
      not be liable for any legal issues or pain and suffering that is experienced as a result of the installation, use, or distribution of this program.
      I am simply a student trying to hone my computer skills before I begin my career and this is my gift to the world.
    </p>
    <p><b>How does it work:</b><br/>
      Well, its quite simple really: Caesura monitors your phone's SMS (a.k.a. text messages) in the background, waiting for a command.
      To control a phone, install the Caesura app <b>on the phone that you want to control</b> (yes, it MUST be on the phone that is being controlled, not 
      yours) and check the 'Enable Service' checkbox on the main Caesura screen. When you want to control the phone in question, all that you have to do is text
      <span style="color:#00AA00"><b>!login</b></span> to that phone, or, if you are a lazy person, install the app on your phone too and click the 'Login to 
      Another Phone' button on the main Caesura screen. After a quick moment or two, the phone will respond and tell you that it is ready for a command. From 
      that moment on, all SMS messages are treated as commands until you send the <span style="color:#00AA00"><b>exit</b></span> command. For a full list of 
      commands, scroll to the bottom of this document <b>DO NOT FORGET TO SEND THE EXIT COMMAND OR ELSE OTHER PEOPLE MAY BE ABLE TO CONTROL PHONE</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>Controlling your own phone:</b>
      To control your own phone remotely, borrow a friend's phone and send a text message containing <span style="color:#00AA00"><b>!login</b></span> to your
      phone. <i>After</i> your phone responds, enter your password and your phone will send a text saying that Caesura is logged in. From this moment on, you can send 
      any command as a text message. For a full list of commands, scroll to the bottom of this document.
    </p>
    <p><b>Controlling someone else's phone:</b>
      Before you consider controlling someone else's phone, consider this: by controlling a phone that belongs to another person, you can play innocent practical
      jokes, however, this app also has the power to read/send sms messages, dial phone numbers, read contacts, etc. Controlling another person's phone (aside
      from your own child's phone, which is legal in some countries) may be illegal. Check your country's laws before use. Alright, now that the "cover my butt"
      clause is out of the way: to control another phone, install this app <b>on the phone that you want to control</b>. The phone being
      controlled must be an Android 2.1 or newer device. However, you can control that phone from any phone (yes, even an iPhone) since commands are sent by text 
      message.
    </p>
    <p><b>Using commands:</b>
      Once you have logged into Caesura remotely from another phone, any text that you send will be treated as a command until you send the <b>exit</b> command.
      To send a command, type it into a text followed by a space and any additional parameters. For example, the <b>toast</b> command which is listed in the commands
      list as: <span style="color:#00AA00">toast [ticker] [text]</span> accepts two additonal parameters, ticker and text (for more information on what these two
      parameters do, read the commands list below). To use this command enter the command name, a space, the ticker, another space, and then the text. 
      For example:<br /><br />
      
      toast [ticker_text] [text] : toast ExampleNotification Hello, this is the notification message<br/><br/>
      
      Notice, although the different parameters are separated by spaces, the last parameter, which is meant to accept a full sentence of text, can have spaces. 
      Some more examples are below, along with the way that they are listed in the command list:<br/><br/>
      
      sendsms [phone_number] [text] : sendsms 9375551919 Hello, this is a text message sent from a phone.<br/>
      call [phone_number] [additional_options] : call 9375551919 speaker<br/>
      help [command] : help torch
    </p>
    <p><b>Commands List:</b>
      <b>!login</b> text this command to phone to connect and start controlling the phone. After you are connected, you can use any of the below commands to interact
      until you are done. When finished, use the <b>exit</b> command to logout. DO NOT FORGET TO LOG OUT.

        <li>
          <b>block [phone_number]</b> Adds [phone_number] to the block list, making the phone being controlled unable to get text messages from that number.

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>more</b> Whenever a Caesura message ends with ...more it means that there is more message that would not fit in the text. This command
          gets the rest of the last response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>speak [text]</b> Makes phone speak out loud. This is a great prank! Replace [text] with words for the phone to say out loud. First time that you send
          this command, the text WILL NOT be spoken because Caesura first has to start up Text To Speech. The second time you send, it will speak. To insure that
          the text spoken can be heard well, use this command to turn the volume up first: Volume media 20
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>volume [channel] [amount]</b> Sets Android system volumes. Replace [channel] with one of the following: media, notifications, alarm, dtmf, ring, sys, and
          replace amount with either mute, unmute, or a value 0 to 20 to set the new volume. 0 represents minimum volume (off) and 20 represents maximum. The different
          channels mean different things. Media is music/apps/TextToSpeeech/etc, notifications is SMS ringtone volume, ring is ringtone volume, alarm is alarm volume,
          dtmf is phone dial tone volumes, and sys is system sounds volume.
        </li>
         <li>
