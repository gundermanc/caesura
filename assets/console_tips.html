    <h3>Caesura Console</h3>
    <p>
      Hello and welcome to Caesura. You are currently in the Caesura Console. Using this screen, you can connect to a remote phone and remote control its
      facilities. If you have not yet read the <b>full</b> Caesura manual, I suggest doing so by visiting www.gundersoft.com/caesura
    </p>
    <p><b>I Think I Know What To Do But It's Not Working:</b><br/>
      Caesura is a complex program. Many people get the wrong idea when first starting out. If it is not working for you, read this paragraph closely.
      For Caesura to remote control a phone, you must install the Caesura App and check the box Labeled "Enable Service" on the <b>remote phone</b>. This
      app does NOT let you control a phone unless it is installed on the phone you are controlling. For more information, read the Instruction Manual or the
      comprehensive guide at www.gundersoft.com/caesura
    </p>
    <p><b>Sending Commands:</b><br/>
      To send commands in Caesura, either type the name of the command or press Menu, Command List for a list of the available commands. Please note:
      although a command shows up in your list, you may not be able to use it if the remote phone is using an older version of Caesura. For more info about
      what a command does, type <b>help [command]</b> and send and the remote phone will respond with instructions on its use.
      For example, to find out how to use the speak command type <b>help speak</b>. For more information on a command, click
      Menu, Instruction Manual and scroll to the command reference at the bottom of the page.
    </p>
    <p><b>Inserting Phone Numbers:</b>
      When remote controlling a phone, sometimes you need to send/do something to another phone. Using the Menu, Insert Phone # option, you can select a 
      phone number from your contacts to help make typing commands easier. For example, to make the remote phone send a text to someone, type <b>sendsms</b>,
      click the Menu, Insert Phone # button, select a number, and then type your message. The end result should look like: <b>sendsms 937-555-1613 
      your message</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>Logging out</b>
      When you first brought up the console, Caesura automatically sent the <b>!login</b> command to log you in to the remote phone. When you are finished
      communicating with the phone, simply press the back button until you return to the main screen of Caesura, or send the <b>exit</b> command. The Console
      will then automatically close and log you out.
